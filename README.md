Max for live granular synthesiser

* Real-time onset sliced granular synthesis (like Ableton's simpler but you can record into the buffer).
* Per-grain effects (SVF filter and delay line).
* Unique granular time stretching algorithm.
* Cool grain polarity modulation options.
* Fully modular: LFO, ramp, random mod source, envelope follower, keytrack and midi CC mod sources.
